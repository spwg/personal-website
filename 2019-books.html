                It's been a few months since I read it. I don't remember much. The lingering memory from it is that starting anything
                new and ambitious is hard. You actually have to make it work - no shortcuts.

              Written by the founder of World Quant. Unusual hiring philosophy, which is basically decentralized/remote before
              it started becoming mainstream. Trying to get alpha everywhere in the world.

              This book reintroduced me to WWII history, and introduced me to the upper class views of the British Empire pre WWI.
              Churchill's life shaped so much of the world today that the story line spans Victorian England rounding
              out its Empire to the start of the Commonwealth. Must read.

              Asks and answers the question, "Why, after the end of the fifteenth century 
              were the Europeans able not only to force their way through to the distant 
              Spice Islands but also to gain control of all the major sea-routes and to establish 
              overseas empires?" The interesting part is that it's written in 1985. The argument is that Europeans
              developed new weapons (better cannons) because they fought
              each other a lot. The English gained a technical edge in making cannons the 1500s that held for a couple hundred years. 
              Materials drove the innovation: iron vs bronze vs steel, etc. Cannons were put onto ships,
              changing naval warfare. The old model was to ram your opponent, board their ship, and fight hand-to-hand. The new
              model was engagement by cannon from a distance. Now, ships could optimize for distance instead of 
              ramming capability. As a result, Europeans were the first to make truly ocean crossing battleships. They could sail
              up and down the coasts of anywhere without true challengers. They used their advantage. The book's filled with tons of
              interesting examples to illustrate its points, but is concise and well written. (This is a Paul Graham <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/raq.html">recommendation</a>.)

              The homes the English ruling class built reflect their ambition and values. It's interesting to see the 
              influence of taste and fashions flowing across geography and social classes.
