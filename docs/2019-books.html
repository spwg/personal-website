          <td>
            Despite the title, these are interviews of founders. It's still really informative to read the stories.
            It's published in 2008, but the founders are still super relevant today.

            Andy Grove, cofounder and former CEO of Intel, wrote this autobiography about his
            immigration to America, i.e. his escape from Hungary, inside the Iron Curtain.
            He also lived in Hungary as a Jew while the Nazis ruled. It's a very interesting story,
            despite the fact that it ends with his move across the continent to the Bay Area after 
            college in NYC.

          <td>Steve Jobs and the NeXT Big Thing</td>
          <td>
            Really interesting to see a critical portrait of Jobs as manageer during a down period
            in his career. The author wrote the book before Jobs pulled off the biggest comeback in
            business history when he returned to Apple.

          <td>
              It's been a few months since I read it. I don't remember much. The lingering memory from it is that starting anything
              new and ambitious is hard. You actually have to make it work - no shortcuts.

          <td>
            Written by the founder of World Quant. Unusual hiring philosophy, which is basically decentralized/remote before
            it started becoming mainstream. Trying to get alpha everywhere in the world.

          <td>Churchill: Walking with Destiny</td>
          <td>
            This book reintroduced me to WWII history, and introduced me to the upper class views of the British Empire pre WWI.
            Churchill's life shaped so much of the world today that the story line spans Victorian England rounding
            out its Empire to the start of the Commonwealth. Must read.

          <td>
            Asks and answers the question, "Why, after the end of the fifteenth century 
            were the Europeans able not only to force their way through to the distant 
            Spice Islands but also to gain control of all the major sea-routes and to establish 
            overseas empires?" The interesting part is that it's written in 1985. The argument is that Europeans
            developed new weapons (better cannons) because they fought
            each other a lot. The English gained a technical edge in making cannons the 1500s that held for a couple hundred years. 
            Materials drove the innovation: iron vs bronze vs steel, etc. Cannons were put onto ships,
            changing naval warfare. The old model was to ram your opponent, board their ship, and fight hand-to-hand. The new
            model was engagement by cannon from a distance. Now, ships could optimize for distance instead of 
            ramming capability. As a result, Europeans were the first to make truly ocean crossing battleships. They could sail
            up and down the coasts of anywhere without true challengers. They used their advantage. The book's filled with tons of
            interesting examples to illustrate its points, but is concise and well written. (This is a Paul Graham recommendation.)

          <td>Life in the English Country House</td>
          <td>
            The homes the English ruling class built reflect their ambition and values. It's interesting to see the 
            influence of taste and fashions flowing across geography and social classes.

          <td>1944</td>
          <td>
            The book is mostly about the year 1944, unsurprisingly. I learned a lot about the US response to the Holocaust. 
            For example, various parts of the US government knew about the extermination camps for more than 12 months
            before the news broke publically. The US didn't act to stop it though. This book did a great job of putting me into
            the mindset of Roosevelt, who was basically the trend-setter for every American presidency after.

          <td>High Output Management</td>
          <td>
            High Output Management is one of the main branches in the tree of knowledge about management. It's particular
            branch might be called "Management of Technology Companies." That's too narrow though. The principles
            Andy Grove writes about are general enough for any organization that produces measurable output. I don't think
            I will read another management book for some time.

          <td>Cryptonomicon</td>
          <td>
            A 1999 novel about paranoid, libertarian Silicon Valley software engineers making a new currency 
            using Japanese war gold buried in the Phillipines and cryptography. My favorite character 
            in the book is Bobby Shaftoe. The writing is fantastic.

          <td>The Code of the Woosters</td>
          <td>
            Totally different from almost everything I've read. First published in 1938, it's set in
            English country houses. It's mostly humor, some romance, and some thriller. There are many 
            plot twists. P.G. Wodehouse is apparently a great English writer. I didn't think his writing 
            was so much better than any other author's, but it is far from mediocore. The writing is
            from a different time period, so perhaps the comparisons are not fair.
