    People looking for their first weightlifting routine
    usually have a problem keeping track of workouts.
    They typically use spreadsheets on small phones
    and/or take a notepad/pencil to the gym.
  </p>
  <p>
    Greyskull LP is the recommended workout <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/phraks-gslp">routine</a> of
    r/Fitness for beginners. So, it has a lot first
    time weightlifters.

    This app simplifies the process of going to
    the gym, working out, and coming home. It allows you
    to track workouts in the routine. You can log workouts
    and set timers between sets so you know when to start
    your next set.

    It is intentionally simple because I wanted to complete it
    fast. It took about nine days to write, test, and submit
    to the app store.
