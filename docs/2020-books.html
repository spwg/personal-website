          <td>
            Good summary and encapsulation of the life of Darwin. Doesn't focus at all on the HMS Beagle
            voyage, which was surprising. The footnotes are really interesting because they explain how 
            Darwin's family edited his autobiography to reflect more acceptable views towards religion. 
            The language and word choices they make are subtle.
