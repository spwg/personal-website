          <td>The Autobiography of Charles Darwin: 1809-1882</td>
          <td>
            Good summary and encapsulation of the life of Darwin. Doesn't focus at all on the HMS Beagle
            voyage, which was surprising. The footnotes are really interesting because they explain how 
            Darwin's family edited his autobiography to reflect more acceptable views towards religion. 
            The language and word choices they make are subtle.

          <td>The Splendid and the Vile: A Saga of Churchill, Family, and Defiance During the Blitz</td>
          <td>
            Focuses on people 
            during the 1st year of Churchill's 1st Prime Ministership. It's interesting because the author quotes
            diaries — which everyone seemed to keep — that show people carrying on normal life as best
            they can, given the circumstances of nightly bombings. For example, a private secretary and 
            Churchill's daughter played tennis after finding a German plane in the English countryside.
            The book's pacing is pleasant. It surprised me how the author dove right into dramatic episodes
            of the war among daily life. For example, important British battles against Rommel in North Africa at Tobruk 
            basically occur during the weekend Churchill's daughter got engaged on a 
            2nd date and then got cold feet. Learned some new stories about how FDR sent men like William Harriman
            and Harry Hopkins to Britain in 1941.

          <td>So Good They Can't Ignore You</td>
          <td>
            A friend recommended this book. It basically says that passion is a bad guide in career 
            development because it's not what most people who actually have successful careers used
            in their lives. Instead, you should build career capital — which is rare and valuable 
            skills — over time in order to get great at what you do. Then you'll love what you do because
            you're great at it. You hone rare and valuable skills with deliberate practice, studying 
            something formally, like in professional chess where there is a literature about
            the game. White collar workers can create their own deliberate practice too by emulating
            disciplines where there is formal study. It should feel hard, like you're really learning
            something.

          <td>Designing Data Intensive Applications</td>
          <td>
            About designing applications that can handle Web-scale
            traffic — hundreds of millions of queries per second, or an equivalently huge amount
            of data — while being reliable, scalable, and maintainable. Fault-tolerance, data models,
            query languages, storage & retrieval, encoding & schema evolution, replication, partitioning,
            transactions, distributed systems, consistency & consensus, batch processing, and stream
            processing.
