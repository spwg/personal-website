      Brown CS Capstone project in a team of three people. Researched and made 
      a bot in Deep Learning (CS 1470) to play Minecraft,
      which is interesting because of the sparse rewards problem (the pay offs from actions come after 
      a really long time) and the hierarchy task planning strategy.
