    People looking for their first weightlifting routine
    usually have a problem keeping track of workouts.
    They typically use spreadsheets on small phones
    and/or take a notepad/pencil to the gym.
  </p>
  <p>
    Greyskull LP is the recommended workout routine of
    r/Fitness for beginners [1]. So, it has a lot first
    time weightlifters.

    This app simplifies the process of going to
    the gym, working out, and coming home. It allows you
    to track workouts in the routine. You can log workouts
    and set timers between sets so you know when to start
    your next set.

    It is intentionally simple because I wanted to ship it
    fast. It took about nine days to write, test, and submit
    to the app store.
  </p>
  <p>
    From the beginning, I strived to make the code testable,
    keep the dependency list small, and focus on core features.
    As a result, I achieved 88.76% line coverage and actually
    shipped the app in a reasonable amount of time despite this
    being my only the 2nd app I've made. To potentially release
    both Android and iOS I chose to use React Native.
