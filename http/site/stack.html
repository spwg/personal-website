      <h2>Why?</h2>
      <p>
          I like using Go because it's reliable, simple, and efficient. It makes using such a tiny
          instance from the Google Cloud free tier more reasonable.

          Gin is a highly efficient web framework with 34k stars on Github. I've used it in a few personal
          projects before and been very pleased by its feature set.

          Cloudflare enables faster page load times because that's just what a CDN is engineered to do. This way,
          fewer requests need to hit the origin server on Google Cloud, which makes it more unlikely that the computational
          resource limits on the GCP free tier are exceeded. Also, I turn on full SSL/TLS from Cloudflare to my origin server,
          which brings me to Certbot.

          Certbot is open source software that gives people free HTTPS certificates using Let's Encrypt. This enables
          the lock in the URL bar of browsers instead of a Not Secure message.

          Debian is a flavor of Linux that seems to just work. I think it was the default on the list from GCP when I created
          the server, and the Brown CS department uses it.

          Google Cloud's dashboard UI is simpler and easier to use than Amazon Web Services's (AWS), which I've used before also.
          (Also, I interned at Google.)
      </p>
      <h2>Why not?</h2>
      <p>
          I am not using Apache, Nginx, or another standard high-powered web server. This site got 5,195 requests from
          November 19, 2019 - December 19, 2019 using 8.74 MB of bandwidth. 2.7 MB of that was cached by Cloudflare. So,
          it's not worth the hassle of setting up and maintaining Apache for pretty light traffic. Most requests are automated
          bots like the Google Crawler or people fishing for misconfigured Wordpress sites.
