    <font face="helvetica">I've always wanted to build my own website. It's easy enough, once you figure it out. Buy a domain name, hack together some HTML code, 
  host it on Github for free, and voila. Anyways, the top three books I've read this summer are Zero to One, Antifragile, and Daemon. 
  My favorite biography has been Theodore Roosevelt's, though Steve Jobs' is a close second. Paul Graham and
  Nassim Nicholas Taleb's blogs are great. The Tim Ferriss podcast has really cool people on as well.</font></p>
