      I wrote a web scraper in Python that inserts the text of Wall Street Journal 
      articles into a SQL database (https://github.com/spwg/wsj-scraper). 
      Right now it navigates to the WSJ login page, logins in using my credentials, clicks the top link on the homepage, 
      logs that article’s text, and then moves onto the first link the article’s content.</p>

    It shouldn’t be too difficult generalize the tool by giving it some additional functions so that it can 
    scrape along more broadly. I’ve never written something in Python before this project but it seems easy enough. 
    Tons of built-in libraries and whatnot.</p>

    The backstory is that I accidentally got roped into the Brown Trading Club’s quant team. 
    I was working on homework in Brown’s Science Library with a friend. He told me he had a meeting with some people. 
    I thought he would be leaving to go to the meeting. Turns out the meeting was at the table we were at. 
    So some guys showed up, started talking about writing a web scraper, and that’s how I got roped in.</p>

    <font face="helvetica">I've always wanted to build my own website. It's easy enough, once you figure it out. Buy a domain name, hack together some HTML code, 
  host it on Github for free, and voila. Anyways, the top three books I've read this summer are Zero to One, Antifragile, and Daemon. 
  My favorite biography has been Theodore Roosevelt's, though Steve Jobs' is a close second. Paul Graham and
  Nassim Nicholas Taleb's blogs are great. The Tim Ferriss podcast has really cool people on as well.</font></p>
