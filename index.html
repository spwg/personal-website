<p>I've always wanted to build my own website. It's easy enough, once you figure it out. Kinda like a lot of other things...</p>
  
<p>Created Summer 2017. Most favorite three overall books I've read this summer are Zero to 
  One, Antifragile, and Daemon. Favorite biography has been Theodore Roosevelt, though
  Alexander Hamilton's is a close second.</p>
