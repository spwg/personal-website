<p>I've always wanted to build my own website. It's easy enough, once you figure it out. Buy a domain name, hack together some HTML code, 
  host it on Github for free, and voila.</p>
<p>The top three books I've read this summer are Zero to One, Antifragile, and Daemon. Favorite biography has been of Theodore Roosevelt, 
  though Steve Jobs is a close second.</p>
