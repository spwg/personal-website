  <p>I've always wanted to build my own website. It's easy enough, once you figure it out. Buy a domain name, hack together some HTML code, 
  host it on Github for free, and voila. Anyways, the top three books I've read this summer are Zero to One, Antifragile, and Daemon. 
  Favorite biography has been of Theodore Roosevelt, though Steve Jobs is a close second. Favorite blogs are by Paul Graham and
  Nassim Nicholas Taleb -- and the Tim Ferriss podcast is great.</p>
