<h1><span>2.1.2 </span>Choose a comfortable&nbsp;measure</h1>


<blockquote class='quote-from-book'>	<p><span class='ic'>“</span>Anything from 45&nbsp;to 75&nbsp;characters is widely regarded as a satisfactory length of line for a single-column page set in a serifed text face in a text size. The 66-character line <span class='bracket'>(</span>counting both letters and spaces<span class='bracket'>)</span> is widely regarded as ideal. For multiple column work, a better average is 40&nbsp;to 50&nbsp;characters.”</p>
 </blockquote>
	<p>The <em>measure</em> is the number of characters in a single line of a column of text. <abbr title="HyperText Mark-up Language">HTML</abbr> doesn’t have a concept of columns per se, instead text is held within <em>boxes</em>. In <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> the width of a box is set using the <code>width</code> property with any unit of length, for&nbsp;example:</p>

<pre><code>#col1 {
  width: 400px;
}

#col2 {
  width: 50%;
}

#col3 {
  width:33em;
}</code></pre>

	<p>When typographers set the measure and text size for printed media, those dimensions are fixed and unchangeable in their physical manifestation. In this regard, the Web as viewed on-screen is fundamentally different to print because the medium is far more under the control of your readers. In particular, if your reader wishes to change the text size or the dimensions of the ‘page’, they can&nbsp;do.</p>

	<p>In the preceding example, column 1&nbsp;has a fixed width: it has been set to 400&nbsp;px wide.  With text rendering at 12&nbsp;px this would result in a measure of approximately 66&nbsp;characters per line. If your reader increases the text size to 16&nbsp;px then the measure reduces to 50&nbsp;characters per line. Thus when the text size is changed, so the measure&nbsp;changes.</p>

	<p>Column 2&nbsp;has a liquid width: it has been set to 50% wide. Assuming your reader is browsing with a window 1000&nbsp;px wide, the box would be rendered as 500&nbsp;px wide, resulting in a measure of about 83&nbsp;characters per line. A measure of 83&nbsp;may be a little too wide for your reader, but because the box is liquid, your reader could reduce their window size to 800&nbsp;px, thus narrowing the box to 400&nbsp;px and creating a more comfortable measure of 66&nbsp;characters per&nbsp;line.</p>

	<p>Column 3&nbsp;has an elastic width: it has been set to 33&nbsp;em wide. On average one character takes up 0.5&nbsp;em so this box will have a measure of 66&nbsp;characters per line. If your reader increases the text size, the width of box will increase accordingly and so the measure remains at 66&nbsp;regardless of the text&nbsp;size.</p>

	<p>From a typographical perspective, the most appropriate method is to set box width in ems <span class='bracket'>(</span>elastic layout<span class='bracket'>)</span> as it ensures the measure is always set to the typographer’s specification. Setting box width as a percentage <span class='bracket'>(</span>liquid layout<span class='bracket'>)</span> gives the typographer approximate control over measure but also allows the reader to adjust the layout to suit their comfort. This website has been designed with liquid layout to afford readers this&nbsp;control.</p>

	<p>Relinquishing such control makes some designers quake in their boots, but the beauty and advantage of the Web as a medium is that readers are able to adjust their reading environment to suit their own needs. This is a concept that should be acknowledged &#38; embraced, and built into website designs from the ground&nbsp;up.</p>

      I wrote a web scraper in Python that inserts the text of Wall Street Journal 
      articles into a SQL database (https://github.com/spwg/wsj-scraper). 
      Right now it navigates to the WSJ login page, logins in using my credentials, clicks the top link on the homepage, 
      logs that article’s text, and then moves onto the first link the article’s content.</p>
  <p><font face="helvetica">
    It shouldn’t be too difficult generalize the tool by giving it some additional functions so that it can 
    scrape along more broadly. I’ve never written something in Python before this project but it seems easy enough. 
    Tons of built-in libraries and whatnot.</p>
  <p>
    The backstory is that I accidentally got roped into the Brown Trading Club’s quant team. 
    I was working on homework in Brown’s Science Library with a friend. He told me he had a meeting with some people. 
    I thought he would be leaving to go to the meeting. Turns out the meeting was at the table we were at. 
    So some guys showed up, started talking about writing a web scraper, and that’s how I got roped in.</p>

    <font face="helvetica">I've always wanted to build my own website. It's easy enough, once you figure it out. Buy a domain name, hack together some HTML code, 
  host it on Github for free, and voila. Anyways, the top three books I've read this summer are Zero to One, Antifragile, and Daemon. 
  My favorite biography has been Theodore Roosevelt's, though Steve Jobs' is a close second. Paul Graham and
  Nassim Nicholas Taleb's blogs are great. The Tim Ferriss podcast has really cool people on as well.</font></p>
