        I wrote a web scraper in Python that inserts the text of Wall Street Journal 
        articles into a SQL database (https://github.com/spwg/wsj-scraper). 
        Right now it navigates to the WSJ login page, logins in using my credentials, 
        clicks the top link on the homepage, 
        logs that article’s text, and then moves onto the first link the article’s content.
        My friend had a meeting with the sentiment trading group of Brown Trading Club, and 
        I overheard them talking about this project.
        That's how I got involved. (October 2017.)

       I've always wanted to build my own website. It's easy enough, once you figure it out. Buy a domain name, hack together some HTML code, 
   host it on Github for free, and voila. Anyways, the top three books I've read this summer are Zero to One, Antifragile, and Daemon. 
   My favorite biography has been Theodore Roosevelt's, though Steve Jobs' is a close second. Paul Graham and
   Nassim Nicholas Taleb's blogs are great. The Tim Ferriss podcast has really cool people on as well.</font>
